# Guidelines for new predicates

This document provides guidelines for developing and contributing new
in-toto Attestation Framework predicate types.

## Preliminary questions

It's important to understand the _why_ for each predicate type.
Before you start developing your new predicate, make sure you can answer the
following questions. This will also help us better understand your request.

-   What's your use case?
-   Why donâ€™t [existing predicates] cover this use case?
-   What might a new predicate type for your use case look like?
(concrete examples in JSON or CUE preferred)
-   What policy questions do you want to be able to answer with the predicate?

## Predicate conventions

We provide a set of common predicate [field types], and recommend the
following conventions for predicates:

-   [Predicates] SHOULD follow and opt-in to the general [parsing rules],
    particularly the monotonic principle, and SHOULD explain what the
    parsing rules are.

-   Field names SHOULD use lowerCamelCase.

-   Timestamps SHOULD use [RFC 3339] syntax with timezone "Z" and SHOULD
    clarify the meaning of the timestamp. For example, a field named
    `timestamp` is too ambiguous; a better name would be `builtAt` or
    `allowedAt` or `scannedAt`.

Predicate designers are free to limit what subject types are valid for a
given predicate type. For example, suppose a "Gerrit code review" predicate
only applies to git commit subjects. In that case, a producer of such
attestations should never use a subject other than a git commit.

## Contributing your new predicate to in-toto

We love to see our list of vetted predicates grow. New attestation predicates
usually undergo a short [vetting process] before they are added to our list.
To start this process, please submit a PR following the [ITE-9] formatting
guidelines.

**IMPORTANT:** Your predicate is yours. This means that in-toto Attestation
Framework maintainers can provide feedback, but will not write the
specification for you.

## Vetting process

Our vetting process is simple.

1.  Open a PR following [ITE-9] formatting guidelines.
2.  The in-toto Attestation Framework maintainers will review the PR at the
    next maintainers meeting.
3.  If accepted, the new predicate type will be included in our directory.
