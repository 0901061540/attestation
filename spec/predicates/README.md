# in-toto Attestation Predicates

Whenever possible, in-toto Attestation Framework users are encouraged
to choose existing attestation predicates that best fit their needs,
although the framework easily supports new predicate types for new use cases.

Anyone is welcome to contribute their new predicate back to the in-toto
community! Please see our [New Predicate Guidelines].
